        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare batter :</strong>
                    To prepare this delicious dessert recipe, take a large bowl and add all-purpose flour in it. Next, add a little amount of water and stir until all lumps get dissolved. Add some more water and make a batter of thin consistency. Whisk the batter for 4-5 minutes, cover and keep it aside for an hour on a warm place.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare maida-mawa mixture :</strong>
                    In the next step, add 2-3 tablespoons of milk in crumbled mawa and mash until it becomes soft. Cover and keep it aside for an hour as well. After 1-hour, mix mawa and maida mixture and whisk until all ingredients blend nicely. Mixture for making mawa jalebi is ready.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare sugar syrup :</strong>
                    Now, dissolve the saffron in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Next, put a pan on medium flame and add sugar in it along with cup water into it. Cook for 2-3 minutes more once the sugar dissolves completely. Check the syrup for its consistency. When the sugar is ready, add saffron water into it and turn off the flame. </li>
                <li><strong>Fry jalebis :</strong>
                    Next, heat ghee in a pan with a heavy bottom or base. Fill up the jalebi mixture in the muslin cloth, tying it completely and making a small hole at the bottom. When the ghee is hot enough, make small jalebis in the form of a spiral. Make 3-4 jalebis or as many as possible in the pan. Fry until they turn golden brown in colour and take them out in a plate.</li>
                <li><strong>Soak in sugar syrup :</strong>
                    Soak these jalebis in sugar syrup for 2 minutes and then take them out in some other plate. Likewise, prepare all jalebis. Serve the Mawa Jalebi hot with rabdi or kheer.</li>
