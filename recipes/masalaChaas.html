        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Made using yoghurt, curry leaves and water, Masala Chaas is a traditional Indian drink and is full of flavours. Using curd as a base, this is a prefect drink for summers to quench the thirst. It provides a cooling effect and helps in beating the scorching summer heat. It also goes best with stuffed parathas and can be enjoyed any time of the day. If you add a tadka made of mustard seeds, cumin seeds and chillies, then its taste becomes super-amazing. You can have it either with your meal or after it. If you are habitual of drinking extra sugary drinks, then this desi drink can easily replace them as a healthy alternative.</p>
